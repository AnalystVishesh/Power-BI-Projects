### Insights

 - Customer Activity and Engagement:
        51.51% of customers are active, while 48.49% are inactive. Strategies are needed to engage inactive customers.

 - Impact of Credit Card Ownership:
        Credit card holders are less likely to churn (30.09% of exit customers are non-credit card holders). Promoting credit card usage could reduce churn.

 - Gender Differences in Churn:
        Female customers have a higher exit rate (55.92%) compared to male customers (44.08%). Tailoring services for female customers might improve retention.

 - Seasonal Trends in Churn:
        Spikes in exit customers are observed in September and November. Investigating these periods could reveal actionable insights for targeted retention efforts.

 - Influence of Credit Scores:
        Poor credit scores have the highest churn rate (22.02%), while good credit scores have the lowest (18.62%). Financial stability plays a significant role in retention.

 - Age and Churn Relationship:
        Among customers with very good credit scores, older customers (50+) have the highest churn rate (46.15%). Providing retirement planning services could help retain this segment.

 - Retention by Credit Score:
        The highest number of retained customers falls within the fair credit score category. Enhancing engagement with this group could improve overall retention.
